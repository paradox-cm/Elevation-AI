# Structured Data & Security Headers Implementation Report

## Overview
- Established reusable JSON-LD helper and wired organization + website schema into the global layout.
- Injected page-level structured data (WebPage, OfferCatalog, AboutPage) on Home, Platform, Solutions, Pricing, and About, leveraging CMS-provided copy so dynamic content continues to drive metadata.
- Tuned icon/accessibility semantics and carousel behavior to preserve mobile UX updates requested in earlier tasks without altering layout.
- Added comprehensive security headers (CSP report-only, HSTS, clickjacking, MIME sniffing, referrer, permissions, legacy XSS) through middleware while keeping Supabase session handling intact.

## Key Files Updated
- `src/app/layout.tsx` – renders organization & website JSON-LD globally.
- `src/components/seo/json-ld.tsx` – reusable helper for structured data injection.
- `src/app/website/{home,platform,solutions,pricing,about}/page.tsx` – page-specific schema markup.
- `src/components/ui/{icon.tsx,platform-carousel.tsx,people-carousel.tsx}` – accessibility semantics and mobile scrolling adjustments.
- `src/middleware.ts` – security headers (CSP report-only, HSTS, additional hardening headers).

## Testing & Verification
- `npx eslint src/app/layout.tsx src/components/seo/json-ld.tsx src/app/website/home/page.tsx src/app/website/platform/page.tsx src/app/website/solutions/page.tsx src/app/website/pricing/page.tsx src/app/website/about/page.tsx src/components/ui/icon.tsx src/components/ui/platform-carousel.tsx`
  - Note: existing lint warnings about legacy `any` usage remain.
- `npx eslint src/middleware.ts`
- Manual smoke pass recommended: public pages, `/admin` login, CMS content edits, carousel interactions, and monitoring browser console for CSP report-only violations.

## Follow-Up Suggestions
1. Review CSP reports (endpoint currently points to `/api/csp-report`) and tighten directives once noise is understood.
2. Address longstanding `any` usage and unused variables flagged by ESLint to improve type safety.
3. Consider formalizing tests (unit or integration) for carousel autoplay/natural scroll permutations as behavior evolves.
