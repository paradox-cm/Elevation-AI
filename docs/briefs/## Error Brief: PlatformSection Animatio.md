## Error Brief: PlatformSection Animation Container Bottom Border Cutoff

**Problem:**
The bottom border of the animation containers in the PlatformSection cards is being cut off on XL/2XL breakpoints (screens wider than 1532px).

**Root Cause:**
The animation containers are being positioned too close to the bottom edge of their parent cards, causing the bottom border to be clipped by the card's boundaries.

**Attempted Solutions:**
1. **Height constraints**: Tried various fixed heights and max-heights for animation containers
2. **Layout approach**: Changed from `justify-end` to flex spacer approach (matching ProblemSection)
3. **Card heights**: Added XL/2XL specific heights to cards
4. **Animation container heights**: Added XL/2XL specific heights to animation containers
5. **Removed height constraints**: Let containers size naturally
6. **Added margins**: Added `mb-2` to animation containers
7. **Extra padding**: Added XL/2XL specific bottom padding to CardContent (`xl:pb-8 2xl:pb-10`)

**Current Status:**
The issue persists despite multiple approaches. The animation container's bottom border is still being cut off on larger screens, indicating the problem may be more fundamental to how the flex layout is calculating available space or how the card boundaries are being enforced.

**Next Steps Needed:**
May require a different approach such as:
- Adjusting the card's internal layout structure
- Using different positioning methods
- Investigating if there are other CSS properties affecting the layout
- Checking if the issue is related to the specific animation components themselves
