## FAQ Categories & Content

### 1. Platform & Architecture
**Icon:** computer-line  
**Description:** How Elevation AI fits into your tech stack and core platform concepts

#### FAQs:
- **How does Elevation AI fit into my stack (data lake, CRM, BI, workflow tools)?**
  - Elevation AI sits between your systems of record and your teams. We ingest from sources like data warehouses/lakes, CRMs, email, docs, and calendars; unify that into a governed Knowledge Graph; and expose it through secure agents, canvases, and APIs. Output actions push back into tools (e.g., Salesforce, Slack, Sheets, ticketing) so the work lands where your teams already operate.

- **What's the difference between a Knowledge Graph and a data warehouse/lake?**
  - A warehouse/lake stores raw tables/files. The Knowledge Graph is a semantic layer that resolves entities (people, companies, deals, assets), relationships, lineage, and policy. It references your data rather than duplicating it, making cross-tool reasoning, permissions, and traceable answers possible.

- **What are Workspaces, Canvases, Agents, and the Library—and how do they relate?**
  - Workspaces: secure domains for a team or entity (e.g., a deal team, portfolio, or family branch). Canvases: collaborative surfaces for tasks/workflows with live context, citations, and approvals. Agents: governed automations that read from the graph and act in your tools. Library: shared, versioned assets—prompts, playbooks, datasets, and integrations—reused across workspaces.

- **Which LLMs and agent frameworks do you support? Can we bring our own models/keys?**
  - We support leading commercial and open-source models via adapters (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Llama family). BYO keys are supported; you can route tasks per policy (by cost, latency, or compliance). Agents use our native orchestrator with tool-use/function-calling; SDKs let you extend it.

- **Can Elevation AI run in our VPC or an air-gapped environment?**
  - Yes. Default is managed SaaS. For higher controls we offer private VPC deployments; fully isolated or "air-gapped" options are available for regulated environments on an enterprise plan.

- **How do you handle data residency (US/EU/other regions)?**
  - Choose a primary region at the org or workspace level. Indexed content, embeddings, logs, and backups remain in-region. Cross-region processing is disabled unless explicitly allowed by policy.

### 2. Security, Privacy & Compliance
**Icon:** shield-check-line  
**Description:** Data protection, privacy controls, and compliance standards

#### FAQs:
- **How do de-identification/re-identification and redaction actually work?**
  - We detect sensitive fields using pattern+ML entity recognition, replace them with reversible tokens, and store originals in a hardened vault. Re-identification requires explicit policy and role-based approval. Persistent redaction can be enforced on export and UI.

- **Do you train models on our data? How do you prevent leakage to third parties?**
  - No customer data is used to train foundation models. BYO keys keep prompts/responses within your vendor account. Optional in-org fine-tuning or adapters are isolated to your tenant. We sign DPAs and restrict subprocessors to those listed in our policy.

- **What controls exist for RBAC/ABAC, SSO (Okta/Azure AD), and SCIM provisioning?**
  - SAML/OIDC SSO, SCIM user lifecycle, role-based access (workspace, dataset, action), and attribute-based controls (labels like "MNPI," "PII," "deal-team-A") are supported. Policies flow through agents, canvases, and APIs.

- **What audit logs and retention controls are available?**
  - Immutable logs cover data access, prompts, model calls, tool actions, exports, and admin changes. Retention is configurable; exports stream to your SIEM. IP allowlists and session policies are available.

- **Which certifications and frameworks do you support (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA)?**
  - We align to SOC 2/ISO 27001 control families and undergo annual third-party penetration tests. GDPR-ready DPAs and SCCs are available. HIPAA/BAA and formal certifications are offered based on plan and deployment; roadmap timelines are provided under NDA.

### 3. Governance & Quality
**Icon:** settings-3-line  
**Description:** Data quality, accuracy controls, and governance features

#### FAQs:
- **How do you ground agent outputs to our source of truth (RAG, citations, provenance)?**
  - All answers resolve back to the graph and indexed sources with inline citations. We use retrieval-augmented generation, entity resolution, and lineage tracking so users can verify "why this answer."

- **What safeguards reduce hallucinations? Can we require human-in-the-loop approvals?**
  - Safeguards include curated retrieval, tool-limited actions, model committees for high-risk tasks, and policy checks. For sensitive flows, require reviewer sign-off, dual-control, or multi-stage approvals before actions execute.

- **How do you version and approve prompts, agents, and flows?**
  - Everything is versioned with draft → review → approved states, change logs, and rollback. Promotion to production requires assigned reviewers; diffs are visible.

### 4. Integrations & Extensibility
**Icon:** links-line  
**Description:** Native integrations, APIs, and custom development options

#### FAQs:
- **Which native integrations are available?**
  - Common connectors include Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft/Google 365, Slack, Drive/SharePoint, Dropbox, Notion, Gmail/Outlook, databases (Postgres, MySQL), warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), storage (S3/GCS/Azure), and finance/data providers (e.g., Plaid/Carta where applicable). Don't see one? Build it with our SDK.

- **Do you have APIs/SDKs and webhooks for custom integrations?**
  - Yes—REST APIs and JS/Python SDKs for ingestion, retrieval, and agent execution. Event/webhook subscriptions let you trigger external workflows on graph or agent events.

- **How does Elevation work with no-code tools we already use (e.g., Zapier/Make)?**
  - Prebuilt Zapier/Make connectors expose triggers (new insight, approval needed, risk flag) and actions (run agent, write to canvas, update record). You can also hit our webhooks directly.

### 5. Implementation & Success
**Icon:** rocket-line  
**Description:** Onboarding process, concierge services, and success metrics

#### FAQs:
- **What does a typical onboarding look like?**
  - A focused 2–6 week path: Discovery (goals, systems, policies) → Connect & model (sources → graph, access controls) → Pilot use cases (2–3 canvases/agents) → Enablement (training, success metrics) → Scale (governance, rollout plan).

- **What exactly does the Concierge Team deliver vs. the product itself?**
  - The product is the platform your team uses daily. The Agentic Concierge Team accelerates value: integration setup, graph curation, playbook design, risk controls, and training. They are enablers—not a custom-dev crutch.

- **What change-management and training resources are included?**
  - Role-based training, in-app guides, office hours, templates, security/approval playbooks, and a champion program to seed expertise internally.

- **How do you measure ROI and success?**
  - We baseline current effort, then track time-to-insight, cycle-time reduction, error rates, compliance exceptions caught, and business outcomes (e.g., faster diligence, better pipeline hygiene). A shared dashboard monitors adoption and savings.

### 6. Pricing & Licensing
**Icon:** price-tag-3-line  
**Description:** Cost structure, credits, and licensing options

#### FAQs:
- **How is pricing structured (platform fee, credits/usage, concierge hours)?**
  - Annual platform subscription by org/workspace tier plus metered usage for model/compute tasks. Concierge services are packaged by outcome (e.g., onboarding, new use-case rollout) or retainer.

- **How do credits work and how can we forecast/limit spend?**
  - Credits meter LLM tokens, retrieval, vector storage, and job runtime. Real-time dashboards, budgets, alerts, and hard caps prevent overages; policies can route tasks to lower-cost models automatically.

- **Do you offer platform-only vs. concierge packages? Seat vs. workspace pricing?**
  - Yes. Choose platform-only or platform+concierge. Pricing can be seat-based, workspace-based, or hybrid depending on your structure, with volume discounts for enterprise.
