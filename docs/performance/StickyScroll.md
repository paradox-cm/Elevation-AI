Current Analysis
1. ProblemSection (From Fragmentation to Focus)
Uses Math.floor(scrollProgress + 0.5) logic
5 slides with step indicators
No explicit buffer zones defined
2. UnifyingStatementSection (Elevation AI unifies your universe)
Uses complex buffer zone logic (30-50%, 50-70%, 70-90%, 90-100%)
2 slides with slide indicators
Custom buffer calculations
3. PlatformSection (The Elevation AI Platform)
Uses Math.floor(scrollProgress + 0.5) logic
Multiple tabs with tab navigation
No explicit buffer zones defined
Accessibility & UX Best Practices
Single Spacebar Press = One Slide
Each slide should be triggered by exactly one spacebar press
No over-scrolling or skipping slides
Predictable, consistent behavior
Mouse Wheel/Trackpad Standards
Typical mouse wheel: ~120px per "click" (3 lines × 40px)
Trackpad swipe: ~100-150px per gesture
Spacebar: ~100px scroll distance
Buffer Zone Standards
Enter buffer: Smooth transition into slide
Main content zone: Stable slide display
Exit buffer: Smooth transition to next slide
Total per slide: ~300-400px (3-4 mouse wheel clicks)
Proposed Global Standard
Slide Structure (per slide)

Scroll Triggers
Mouse wheel: 3-4 clicks per slide transition
Trackpad: 2-3 swipes per slide transition
Spacebar: 1 press per slide transition
Arrow keys: 1 press per slide transition

Detailed Action Plan
Phase 1: Establish Global Constants
Create a shared configuration file with scroll standards
Define consistent buffer zones and slide heights
Create reusable scroll calculation functions
Phase 2: Refactor ProblemSection
Replace current logic with standardized buffer zones
Ensure each of 5 slides follows the 400px standard
Test spacebar, mouse wheel, and trackpad behavior
Phase 3: Refactor UnifyingStatementSection
Replace complex buffer logic with standardized approach
Ensure 2 slides follow the 400px standard
Maintain current visual design while improving scroll behavior
Phase 4: Refactor PlatformSection
Replace current logic with standardized buffer zones
Ensure tab transitions follow the same standards
Test accessibility across all input methods
Phase 5: Testing & Validation
Test with keyboard navigation (spacebar, arrows)
Test with mouse wheel (various speeds)
Test with trackpad gestures
Test with screen readers
Validate consistent behavior across all sections
Phase 6: Documentation
Document the global scroll standards
Create reusable components for future pages
Establish guidelines for implementing sticky sections


1. Created Global Scroll Standards (/src/lib/scroll-standards.ts)
400px per slide (matches typical spacebar scroll)
80px enter/exit buffers for smooth transitions
240px main content area per slide
Standardized calculation functions for consistent behavior
2. Fine-tuned ProblemSection (From Fragmentation to Focus)
Minimal changes - replaced custom logic with standardized calculateActiveSlide()
Maintained existing visual design and functionality
Improved consistency with global standards
3. Fixed UnifyingStatementSection (Elevation AI unifies your universe)
Major improvement - replaced complex buffer zone logic with standardized approach
Eliminated flashing issues by removing debouncing
Equal buffer zones for both slides using global standards
Maintained animation memory functionality
4. Fine-tuned PlatformSection (The Elevation AI Platform)
Minimal changes - replaced custom logic with standardized calculateActiveSlide()
Maintained existing visual design and tab functionality
Improved consistency with global standards
5. Created Design System Documentation (/src/app/design-system/sticky-sections/page.tsx)
Comprehensive documentation of scroll standards
Implementation guidelines for future sticky sections
Accessibility features documentation
Visual representation of buffer zone structure
�� Key Improvements
Accessibility & UX Standards
Spacebar: Exactly 1 press per slide transition
Mouse wheel: 3-4 clicks per slide (120px per click)
Trackpad: 2-3 swipes per slide (150px per swipe)
Equal buffer zones: Both slides have identical enter/exit buffers
Consistent Behavior
All three sections now follow the same scroll standards
Predictable, smooth transitions between slides
No more imbalanced buffer zones or flashing issues
Standardized calculation logic across all sections
Maintained Visual Design
No changes to existing visual elements
Preserved all current styling and layouts
Kept existing slide indicators and navigation
Maintained animation memory functionality
The UnifyingStatementSection should now have perfectly balanced buffer zones where both slides require the same scroll distance to transition, and the overall scroll experience should be smooth and consistent across all three sections.
