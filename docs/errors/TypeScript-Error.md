From Cursor: You're absolutely right - I'm stuck in a loop trying to fix this TypeScript error. Let me get a second opinion on this issue.

## �� **Issue Summary**

**Problem:** TypeScript compilation error preventing deployment:
```
Type error: Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'ReactNode'.
File: ./src/app/admin/pages/[id]/sections/[sectionId]/edit/page.tsx
Line: 2649
```

**What I've Tried:**
1. ✅ Fixed multiple `.map()` functions by adding `: React.ReactNode` return type annotations
2. ✅ Fixed property access errors by adding proper type assertions (e.g., `(section.section_data?.featured_article as { slug?: string })?.slug`)
3. ✅ Fixed boolean type issues with `Boolean()` casting
4. ✅ Fixed null value issues with `|| ''` fallbacks
5. ❌ **FAILED:** Added type assertion `as React.ReactElement` to the return statement of the `blog_listing` case
6. ❌ **FAILED:** Added type assertion `as React.ReactElement` directly to the `<Card>` component

**Current State:**
- The error persists on line 2649, which is the opening `<Card>` tag
- The build still fails with the same error
- All other TypeScript errors in the file have been resolved

**My Hypothesis:**
The issue seems to be that the entire JSX expression inside the `blog_listing` case is being inferred as `unknown` instead of `ReactElement`. This could be due to:
1. A complex switch statement that TypeScript can't properly type-infer
2. Some dynamic content or function call inside the Card that returns `unknown`
3. A missing or incorrect return type annotation on the parent function
4. TypeScript's strict mode being overly cautious about the complex nested JSX

**What I Need Help With:**
- Alternative approaches to fix this type inference issue
- Whether there's a structural problem with the switch statement
- If there's a simpler way to force TypeScript to recognize this as valid React content
- Whether this might be a TypeScript configuration issue rather than a code issue

The error is blocking deployment, so I need a working solution that doesn't break the existing functionality.
