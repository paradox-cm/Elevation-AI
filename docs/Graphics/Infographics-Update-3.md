The left rail and the flow lane collide: the “Models” labels visually intrude into the step row, indicating the rail’s width or content height is overlapping the main lane.

The step cards compress and/or clip: several step titles spill to two lines or are cut mid-word; metric chips wrap beneath titles, shrinking the card’s usable height.

The six steps don’t form a single clean row: spacing between steps is inconsistent, with some steps nudged closer than others; the overall row appears narrower than the lane area.

Arrows/tokens aren’t centered on cards: the traveling dot and connection arrows appear offset vertically, not aligned to the visual center of each step card.

The policy pill sits too close to the lane: it visually overlaps the first card’s hit area; spacing above/below the pill is uneven.

Rail sections crowd: “Tools / Models / Policies” stack without consistent vertical rhythm; row heights differ and some labels appear misaligned to their bullets/toggles.

The header bar and the board share the same vertical space: “Workspace: Atlas” + avatars + “Add Canvas” crowd the top of Column 1, so the first row of cards starts higher in the left column than the others.

Card heights look identical, but internals don’t fit: on several cards, the chips row and the footer icons occupy the same vertical band; the excerpt line is partially obscured or truncated mid-baseline.

Intra-column spacing is inconsistent: the vertical gaps between cards vary; some cards sit almost flush while others show visible gaps larger than the specified rhythm.

Column gutters aren’t even: the space between “Inbox → In Progress” differs from “In Progress → Done”, giving a skewed three-column grid.

Text truncation is inconsistent: some titles/excerpts truncate cleanly; others wrap into a second line that pushes the icons down and visually breaks the uniform height.

Icon row alignment drifts: the three quick-action icons are not baseline-aligned across cards; some sit higher/lower, creating a wavy footer line.

The left table’s columns reflow unpredictably: “Action” and “Resource” wrap on some rows but not others, causing zig-zag row heights and misaligned baselines across the table.

Masked values render wider than unmasked: {redacted} appears to expand certain cells and pushes neighboring columns, hinting at inconsistent font or whitespace handling.

The table and right panel touch: the vertical divider or column gap between the table and “Evidence Pack” panel is minimal; visually they read as one block.

Header chips crowd the first row: “User / Policy / Resource / Outcome” filter chips sit directly above the table with almost no separation; the first data row is cramped under them.

Export control floats ambiguously: the “Export” button aligns to the right but sits at the same vertical level as the chips, visually belonging to neither the filter group nor the side panel.

Platform — Workspaces

The sidebar list wraps: at least one workspace name shows ellipsis but the row height is taller than others, implying different line heights per item.

Row 1 widgets don’t share a uniform height: the three top widgets show slightly different vertical sizes; card borders don’t align on a single baseline.

Row 1 and Row 2 crowd: the second row of “mini smart cards” visually overlaps the padding of the first row; there’s no consistent inter-row spacing.

Widget titles collide with contents: in the first widget, the count and chips force the title to share the same vertical band; in the third widget, the metadata chips push against the bottom edge.

Board preview bleeds: the mini smart cards in Row 2 appear to push against the main panel’s right padding; their right borders look closer to the container edge than the left side.

Top bar controls sit off-grid: “Open Pipeline” / “Start Flow” buttons don’t align vertically with the title baseline or with the avatars; spacing above/below is uneven.

The routing table line-wraps within cells: “Condition” and “Model/Tool” columns wrap mid-term, breaking the table’s rectangular rhythm; some rows are taller.

Policy column width fluctuates per row: the rightmost column appears to change width based on content, nudging other columns and producing misaligned cell boundaries.

Divider between table and live stream is visually thin: the bottom section looks attached to the table; the sections don’t read as distinct blocks.

In Live Requests, the chip cluster overlaps row text: matched-rule chips cover or collide with the request label on narrower rows; the label loses legibility.

Policy Gate panel squeezes the stream: the fixed gate card on the right appears to consume more horizontal space than allotted; the request list compresses, causing its chips to wrap or clip.

Row heights vary across the stream: some request rows look 1–2px taller; baselines are not aligned, giving a rippled list appearance.
