Here's a comprehensive description of the current animation state and behavior for the "Elevation AI unifies your universe" section:

## Current Animation Status
The section has been completely refactored to work exactly like the "From Fragmentation to Focus" carousel section, with scroll-triggered text progression that becomes sticky and allows smooth scrolling up and down through the two text states. **NEW**: Text animations no longer replay once they've been completed. **FIXED**: Section now has proper body scroll control to stop page scrolling when sticky, just like the other sections.

## Desired Behavior Flow (Currently Working)
1. **Initial Scroll**: User scrolls past the vertical carousel section ("From Fragmentation to Focus")
2. **Parallax Entry**: The blue gradient text animation section slides over/on top of the vertical carousel section with a parallax effect
3. **Sticky Container**: The section becomes sticky at the top of the viewport (below navigation) with a scroll spacer
4. **Scroll-triggered Progression**: As the user scrolls through the section, the first text appears, then the second text
5. **Reverse Scrolling**: Users can scroll back up through the same text states in reverse order
6. **Smooth Transitions**: Text states transition smoothly with opacity changes, just like the carousel
7. **Section Exit**: The section scrolls past and reveals the next section ("The Elevation AI Platform")

## NEW: Animation Memory Behavior
- **First Visit**: Both text animations play normally with typewriter effect
- **Subsequent Visits**: Once an animation has been completed, it will show the full text immediately without replaying the typewriter animation
- **Carousel-like Behavior**: Works exactly like the "From Fragmentation to Focus" section - scroll up and down through text states
- **Smooth Transitions**: Text states transition with opacity changes, just like the carousel slides
- **Sticky Container**: Section becomes sticky with scroll spacer, allowing natural scroll progression
- **Reverse Scrolling**: Users can scroll back up through the same text states in reverse order
- **Re-entry Behavior**: When scrolling past the section and then back up, it becomes sticky again at the same position

## Key Features Implemented
- **Parallax effect** over the previous section
- **Sticky container** with scroll spacer (like carousel)
- **Scroll-triggered text progression** based on scroll position
- **Smooth opacity transitions** between text states
- **Slide indicators** at the bottom showing progress (4px height Ã— 88px width, blue for active, gray for inactive)
- **Animation memory** - completed animations don't replay
- **Left-justified text** in original position
- **Proper indicator spacing** with bottom padding
- **Fixed height container** matching original dimensions
- **Mobile responsive** layout with stacked text display
- **Maintains existing functionality** of other sections

## Technical Implementation
- Uses `sticky top-20` positioning with scroll spacer (like carousel)
- Scroll event listener for text progression based on scroll position
- **NEW**: Carousel-like structure with `activeStep` state
- **NEW**: Persistent state tracking for animation completion (`hasFirstAnimationEverCompleted`, `hasSecondAnimationEverCompleted`)
- **NEW**: `skipAnimation` prop in TypewriterText component
- **NEW**: Body scroll control (`overflow: hidden`, `position: fixed`) when section is sticky
- **NEW**: Wheel event handling for progression control when sticky
- Scroll position calculation for determining active text state
- Smooth opacity transitions between text states
- Mobile and desktop responsive layouts

## Current State Variables
- `activeStep`: Current active text state (0 or 1)
- `sectionRef`: Reference to the section element
- **NEW**: `hasFirstAnimationEverCompleted`: First animation has been completed at least once
- **NEW**: `hasSecondAnimationEverCompleted`: Second animation has been completed at least once
- `texts`: Array of text objects with content and keys

## Slide Indicators
- Two indicators positioned at bottom-left with proper padding matching the text margins
- First indicator: Active when first animation is running
- Second indicator: Active when second animation is running or during exit
- Always one indicator is active
- Smooth color transitions between states

## Animation Memory Logic
- **First Animation**: Only animates if `hasFirstAnimationEverCompleted` is false
- **Second Animation**: Only animates if `hasSecondAnimationEverCompleted` is false
- **Skip Animation**: When `skipAnimation` prop is true, TypewriterText shows full text immediately
- **State Persistence**: Animation completion states persist across scroll cycles
- **Carousel-like Progression**: Text states change based on scroll position, just like carousel slides
- **Component Stability**: TypewriterText components use stable keys to prevent unnecessary remounts
- **Smooth Transitions**: Opacity transitions between text states for smooth user experience
- **Scroll-based Activation**: Text states activate based on scroll position within the sticky container

The section now behaves exactly as specified in the target behavior document, with proper scroll progression, animation timing, visual feedback through the slide indicators, and the new animation memory feature that prevents replaying completed animations while maintaining all scroll functionality.
