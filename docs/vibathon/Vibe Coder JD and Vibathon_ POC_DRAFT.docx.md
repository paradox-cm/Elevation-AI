### **1\. Vibathon Executive Summary (Internal Document)**

To: Elevation AI Leadership

From: Hiring Team

Date: September 26, 2025

Subject: Project Vibathon \- A New Model for Hiring Product-Minded Builders

#### **The Opportunity: Finding the "Vibe Coder"**

We have a critical gap between Sales and Delivery for a role that is less about traditional engineering and more about intuitive, rapid, product-centric building. This person doesn't just fulfill a spec sheet; they capture the *vibe* of a client's problem and bring a solution to life that *feels* right. They are design-forward hackers and customer-obsessed builders who leverage a new class of AI-first development tools.

#### **The Solution: The Elevation AI Vibathon**

We propose creating a competitive hiring event called the "Vibathon."

* **What it is:** A **single-day, intensive,** invite-only virtual event where top applicants are challenged to build a proof-of-concept (POC) for a real-world client scenario using our platform and approved tools.  
* **What it's NOT:** A traditional hackathon or a coding test.  
* **The Goal:** To identify individuals who excel at turning ambiguity into a compelling, working prototype under pressure. The winner(s) will be extended an offer for the new **Vibe Prototyper** role.

#### **The "Vibe Prototyper" Profile**

We are looking for a unique blend of skills that defy traditional titles:

* **Product Intuition:** They think "why" before "how." They can empathize with a user's pain points and design a solution that delivers immediate value.  
* **Rapid Prototyping:** They are masters of modern **"vibe code" tools (like Replit, Cursor, Lovable, Windsurf)**, backend platforms like **Supabase**, no-code workflow tools (**n8n**, Zapier, Make), and APIs. They stitch together functional demos in hours, not weeks, without needing traditional software development cycles.  
* **Creative Problem Solving:** They are scrappy, inventive, and have a "bias for action." They find clever ways to showcase the art of the possible.  
* **Storytelling:** They can present their creation not just as a tool, but as a solution, explaining its value and vision clearly to both sales and technical stakeholders.

#### **Evaluation Criteria**

Participants will be judged on a holistic set of criteria:

* **Insight & Creativity (40%):** How well did they understand the core "vibe" of the problem? Was their solution inventive and insightful?  
* **User Experience & Design (30%):** How does the prototype *feel* to use? Is it intuitive and focused on the end-user's outcome?  
* **Build & Execution (20%):** Did they successfully create a working, demonstrable POC?  
* **Handoff Readiness (10%):** Is the work documented clearly enough for our Delivery team to understand the "why" and "how" of the build?

#### **Desired Outcome**

By hosting the Vibathon, we will:

* Hire 1-2 world-class **Vibe Prototypers** who are a perfect culture and skills fit.  
* Generate high-quality, authentic marketing content showcasing Elevation AI as an innovative place to work.  
* Build a pipeline of exceptional, product-minded talent for future roles.

**Can You Vibe?** ðŸ’¡

Are you a builder who sees a user problem and just *knows* how to solve it? Do you live to turn chaotic ideas into clean, elegant prototypes that just *work*?

Forget what you know about traditional coding. We're not looking for computer scientists; we're looking for creative orchestrators. This is about building at the speed of thought.

**Welcome to the Elevation AI Vibathon.**

This isn't a hackathon. It's a **lightning-fast, one-day remote sprint** to find the most intuitive, product-minded builders on the planet. Weâ€™ll give you a real-world challenge faced by one of our clients and access to the Elevation AI platform. Your mission: **Orchestrate a universe of data and agents into a working prototype that solves a massive business problemâ€”before the day is out.** ðŸš€

#### **Who We're Looking For: The Vibe Coder**

* You're a **product person** who can prototype, a **designer** who can build, or a **hacker** with a deep sense of user empathy.  
* Your creative toolkit includes modern, AI-powered environments like **Replit, Lovable, Cursor, or Windsurf**, and backend platforms like **Supabase**. You think in terms of APIs and workflows, using platforms like **n8n**, Zapier, or Make as your connective tissue.  
* You don't need to be a traditional coder; you need to be a masterful **builder**. Your gift is knowing *what* to build and *how* to bring it to life, fast.  
* You believe the best products have a "vibe"â€”a feeling of intuitive rightness that can't be A/B tested.

#### **Why You Should Vibe With Us**

* **The Ultimate Prize:** The winner(s) will receive a full-time offer to join Elevation AI as a **Vibe Prototyper**, a core role shaping the future of agentic AI for our top clients.  
* **Build What's Next:** Work directly with the core tools of the agentic eraâ€”LLMs, vector databases, and our own orchestration platform.

#### **Summary**

Elevation AI is seeking a creative and product-obsessed **Vibe Prototyper** to join our team. This isn't a coding role in the traditional sense. We're looking for an intuitive **builder** who leverages modern, AI-assisted tools to **rapidly** translate complex client needs into elegant, working proofs-of-concept (POCs). You'll be the bridge between a client's vision and our platform's power, using your "vibe" to show, not just tell, what's possible in the agentic era.

Your mission is to capture the essence of a problem and build a solution that delivers immediate insight and value, paving the way for our Delivery team.

#### **How You'll Work: The Art of Vibe Coding**

We believe in a different way of building, centered on a few core principles:

* **Intuition Over Instruction:** You lean into the "art of the possible," guided by client outcomes and user empathy rather than rigid specs.  
* **Speed as a Strategy:** You build in hours or days, not weeks. Your goal is progress and rapid iteration to get to the core of the solution.  
* **Beauty in the Build:** You create clean, visually appealing, and intuitive demos. Your prototypes are the sales pitch.  
* **Storytelling Through Documentation:** Your handoffs are more than just technical artifacts; they are well-documented blueprints that tell the story of the solution, ensuring the Delivery team understands the "why" behind your build.

#### **Your Responsibilities**

* **Translate Vision to Reality:** Work with the Sales team to understand the core of a client's needs and ideate creative, high-impact POCs.  
* **Build with Vibe:** Use your favorite "vibe code" environments and no-code tools to stitch together agents and workflows into compelling, functional prototypes.  
* **Champion the User:** Obsess over the user experience of your prototypes, ensuring they are intuitive, elegant, and directly address the client's biggest pain points.  
* **Create Clear Blueprints:** Rigorously document your builds, providing a seamless and high-trust handoff to the Delivery team for every project.  
* **Shape Our Process:** Help build our internal library of reusable frameworks, templates, and "vibes" to make future prototyping even faster and more impactful.

#### **Your Toolkit & Mindset**

We care more about your mindset and your portfolio than a specific list of skills.

* **Mindset:** You thrive in fast-paced environments, are a crystal-clear communicator, and are endlessly curious. You are a hacker, a builder, and a customer-focused product person at heart.  
* **Vibe Coding Environments:** You are proficient in one or more modern, AI-assisted building environments like **Replit, Lovable, Cursor, Windsurf,** backend-as-a-service platforms like **Supabase,** or similar tools. **Traditional coding skills are a bonus, not a requirement; your expertise lies** in building and shipping with speed.  
* **Workflow Automation:** You are a wizard with platforms like **n8n**, **Zapier**, **Make**, or similar no-code/low-code tools.  
* **Experience:** You have a portfolio of projects (professional or personal) that demonstrate your ability to turn ambiguous ideas into tangible, working products. We are hiring at multiple levels based on the depth and independence shown in your past work.
