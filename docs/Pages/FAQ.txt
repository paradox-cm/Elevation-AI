Platform & architecture

How does Elevation AI fit into my stack (data lake, CRM, BI, workflow tools)?
Elevation AI sits between your systems of record and your teams. We ingest from sources like data warehouses/lakes, CRMs, email, docs, and calendars; unify that into a governed Knowledge Graph; and expose it through secure agents, canvases, and APIs. Output actions push back into tools (e.g., Salesforce, Slack, Sheets, ticketing) so the work lands where your teams already operate.

What’s the difference between a Knowledge Graph and a data warehouse/lake?
A warehouse/lake stores raw tables/files. The Knowledge Graph is a semantic layer that resolves entities (people, companies, deals, assets), relationships, lineage, and policy. It references your data rather than duplicating it, making cross-tool reasoning, permissions, and traceable answers possible.

What are Workspaces, Canvases, Agents, and the Library—and how do they relate?

Workspaces: secure domains for a team or entity (e.g., a deal team, portfolio, or family branch).

Canvases: collaborative surfaces for tasks/workflows with live context, citations, and approvals.

Agents: governed automations that read from the graph and act in your tools.

Library: shared, versioned assets—prompts, playbooks, datasets, and integrations—reused across workspaces.

Which LLMs and agent frameworks do you support? Can we bring our own models/keys?
We support leading commercial and open-source models via adapters (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Google, Mistral, Llama family). BYO keys are supported; you can route tasks per policy (by cost, latency, or compliance). Agents use our native orchestrator with tool-use/function-calling; SDKs let you extend it.

Can Elevation AI run in our VPC or an air-gapped environment?
Yes. Default is managed SaaS. For higher controls we offer private VPC deployments; fully isolated or “air-gapped” options are available for regulated environments on an enterprise plan.

How do you handle data residency (US/EU/other regions)?
Choose a primary region at the org or workspace level. Indexed content, embeddings, logs, and backups remain in-region. Cross-region processing is disabled unless explicitly allowed by policy.

Security, privacy & compliance

How do de-identification/re-identification and redaction actually work?
We detect sensitive fields using pattern+ML entity recognition, replace them with reversible tokens, and store originals in a hardened vault. Re-identification requires explicit policy and role-based approval. Persistent redaction can be enforced on export and UI.

Do you train models on our data? How do you prevent leakage to third parties?
No customer data is used to train foundation models. BYO keys keep prompts/responses within your vendor account. Optional in-org fine-tuning or adapters are isolated to your tenant. We sign DPAs and restrict subprocessors to those listed in our policy.

What controls exist for RBAC/ABAC, SSO (Okta/Azure AD), and SCIM provisioning?
SAML/OIDC SSO, SCIM user lifecycle, role-based access (workspace, dataset, action), and attribute-based controls (labels like “MNPI,” “PII,” “deal-team-A”) are supported. Policies flow through agents, canvases, and APIs.

What audit logs and retention controls are available?
Immutable logs cover data access, prompts, model calls, tool actions, exports, and admin changes. Retention is configurable; exports stream to your SIEM. IP allowlists and session policies are available.

Which certifications and frameworks do you support (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA)? What’s on the roadmap?
We align to SOC 2/ISO 27001 control families and undergo annual third-party penetration tests. GDPR-ready DPAs and SCCs are available. HIPAA/BAA and formal certifications are offered based on plan and deployment; roadmap timelines are provided under NDA.

How are client/portfolio-company boundaries enforced in multi-org setups?
Tenant isolation, workspace scoping, per-entity encryption keys, and policy labels prevent cross-entity access. “Deal-team walls”/information barriers enforce need-to-know by default; exceptions require auditable approvals.

Governance & quality

How do you ground agent outputs to our source of truth (RAG, citations, provenance)?
All answers resolve back to the graph and indexed sources with inline citations. We use retrieval-augmented generation, entity resolution, and lineage tracking so users can verify “why this answer.”

What safeguards reduce hallucinations? Can we require human-in-the-loop approvals?
Safeguards include curated retrieval, tool-limited actions, model committees for high-risk tasks, and policy checks. For sensitive flows, require reviewer sign-off, dual-control, or multi-stage approvals before actions execute.

How do you version and approve prompts, agents, and flows?
Everything is versioned with draft → review → approved states, change logs, and rollback. Promotion to production requires assigned reviewers; diffs are visible.

Integrations & extensibility

Which native integrations are available?
Common connectors include Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft/Google 365, Slack, Drive/SharePoint, Dropbox, Notion, Gmail/Outlook, databases (Postgres, MySQL), warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), storage (S3/GCS/Azure), and finance/data providers (e.g., Plaid/Carta where applicable). Don’t see one? Build it with our SDK.

Do you have APIs/SDKs and webhooks for custom integrations?
Yes—REST APIs and JS/Python SDKs for ingestion, retrieval, and agent execution. Event/webhook subscriptions let you trigger external workflows on graph or agent events.

How does Elevation work with no-code tools we already use (e.g., Zapier/Make)?
Prebuilt Zapier/Make connectors expose triggers (new insight, approval needed, risk flag) and actions (run agent, write to canvas, update record). You can also hit our webhooks directly.

Implementation & success

What does a typical onboarding look like?
A focused 2–6 week path:

Discovery (goals, systems, policies)

Connect & model (sources → graph, access controls)

Pilot use cases (2–3 canvases/agents)

Enablement (training, success metrics)

Scale (governance, rollout plan)

What exactly does the Concierge Team deliver vs. the product itself?
The product is the platform your team uses daily. The Agentic Concierge Team accelerates value: integration setup, graph curation, playbook design, risk controls, and training. They are enablers—not a custom-dev crutch.

What change-management and training resources are included?
Role-based training, in-app guides, office hours, templates, security/approval playbooks, and a champion program to seed expertise internally.

How do you measure ROI and success?
We baseline current effort, then track time-to-insight, cycle-time reduction, error rates, compliance exceptions caught, and business outcomes (e.g., faster diligence, better pipeline hygiene). A shared dashboard monitors adoption and savings.

Pricing & licensing

How is pricing structured (platform fee, credits/usage, concierge hours)?
Annual platform subscription by org/workspace tier plus metered usage for model/compute tasks. Concierge services are packaged by outcome (e.g., onboarding, new use-case rollout) or retainer.

How do credits work and how can we forecast/limit spend?
Credits meter LLM tokens, retrieval, vector storage, and job runtime. Real-time dashboards, budgets, alerts, and hard caps prevent overages; policies can route tasks to lower-cost models automatically.

Do you offer platform-only vs. concierge packages? Seat vs. workspace pricing?
Yes. Choose platform-only or platform+concierge. Pricing can be seat-based, workspace-based, or hybrid depending on your structure, with volume discounts for enterprise.

Data lifecycle & portability

How do we import existing documents, emails, and meeting transcripts?
Use native connectors, secure bulk import (S3/GCS), or APIs. We normalize and deduplicate, then map entities/relationships into the graph with lineage preserved.

Can we export our knowledge graph and all associated data if we leave?
Yes. Full export via API/Admin in open formats (JSON-LD/CSV/Parquet), including entities, relationships, citations, and optional embeddings. We provide export runbooks.

What is your data deletion process and timeline?
Deletion requests tombstone records immediately, purge hot storage within 24 hours, and remove from backups within 30 days (or your policy). Cryptographic erasure applies to customer-managed keys.

SLAs, support & reliability

What uptime, response times, and incident processes do you offer?
Standard SLA targets 99.9% uptime (higher available on private deployments). P1 incidents receive rapid acknowledgment and continuous updates until resolved. Post-incident RCAs are shared.

What support tiers are available (hours, channels, dedicated manager)?
Standard (business hours, email/portal), Priority (24×5 + chat), and Enterprise (24×7 + Slack Connect + named CSM/TAM). We tailor runbooks and escalation paths to your org.

Do you provide disaster recovery and business continuity details?
Yes—multi-AZ architecture, automated backups, periodic restore tests, and documented RTO/RPO targets. DR/BCP documentation and test summaries are available under NDA.

Segment-specific

Family offices: How do you handle multi-entity structures, beneficiaries, and sensitive records?
Workspaces mirror legal/entity structure; policy labels (e.g., trust, beneficiary, medical/PII) gate access and re-identification. Sensitive vaults and approval flows keep human oversight where it matters.

VC/PE/IB: Can you enforce deal-team walls and information barriers?
Yes. Deal-team walls, MNPI tagging, pre-trade checks, and auditable approvals. Agents can be constrained to specific datasets/tools; all outputs carry provenance and retention policies.

Banks/government: What compliance/audit features exist for regulated environments?
Private VPC deployments, customer-managed keys, detailed audit/event exports, data-loss policies, and restricted model routing. We map controls to frameworks (e.g., NIST families) and support external audits.

Legal & procurement

Do you offer DPAs, MSAs, and third-party pen-test summaries for vendor reviews?
Yes. Standard MSA/DPA (with SCCs where needed), security questionnaires (SIG Lite/CAIQ), and recent penetration-test summaries are available under NDA.

What is your stance on IP ownership for custom agents/flows created on the platform?
You own the IP for agents, prompts, and playbooks created for your org. We retain IP to the platform and grant you a license to use our components; you grant us a limited license to operate your assets within the service.

Internationalization & accessibility

Which languages and locales are supported?
The product supports multilingual content understanding and generation via model routing. UI is English-first with additional locales rolling out; date/time/number formats respect workspace locale.

Do you meet accessibility standards (WCAG) across the app?
We design to WCAG 2.1 AA (keyboard nav, screen-reader labels, contrast modes) and actively close gaps as standards evolve.
